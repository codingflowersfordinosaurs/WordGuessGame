# WordGuessGame (Hangman)
<!-- TITLE -->
<p>Theme: Pokemon the First Generation</p>
<br>
<!-- WHAT THE PROJECT DOES -->
<h2>What the project does</h2>
<p>The Word Guess Game is essentially the 'Hangman' game without the hanging man illustration<p>
<p>There are 5 sections that house: wins, losses, number of guesses left, wrong letters, and correct letters</p>
<br>
<!-- HOW TO PLAY THE GAME -->
<h2>Playing the Game</h2>
<p><strong>First:</strong></p>
<p>Click on the "Start a New Game" button</p>
<p>This will start the game and have a random word for you(the user) to figure out (underscores will appear in the "Fill These In" section</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Second:</strong></p>
<p>Press any of the letter keys(a to z) to try and figure out the mystery word</p>
<p>You(the user) will have 7 guesses</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Third:</strong> </p>
<p>If you(the user) guesses the RIGHT word, the "Wins" section will increment by 1</p>
<p>If a guessed letter is correct, it will take an underscore's place</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Fourth:</strong></p>
<p>If a guessed letter is incorrect, the "Guesses Left" section will decrement by 1</p>
<p>If a guessed letter is incorrect, it will be placed in the "Incorrect Letters Guessed" section</p>
<p><strong>Fifth:</strong></p>
<p>When "Guesses Left" reaches 0, the "Losses" section will increment by 1</p>
<p><strong>Sixth:</strong></p>
<p>When you(the user) either win(fill in the spaces without losing the number of guesses) or lose(fail to guess the word when the number of guesses runs out) PRESS the "Start a New Game" button to start another round</p>
<!-- WHY THE PROJECT IS USEFUL -->
<h2>Why the project is useful</h2>
<p>This project is useful because: </p>
<p>required HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</p>
<br>
<h4>I found the JavaScript to be the most difficult</h4>
<p>I finally realized that drawing out a plan ON PAPER and then writing out pseudo-code as to what I had to tackle ("big picture ideas") FIRST were the best route to take when making this game</p>
<p>This game MADE me learn. It made me learn Javascript, HTML, and CSS altogether</p>
<p>This is why I believe this project is useful</p>
<br><br>
<!-- HOW USERS CAN GET STARTED WITH THE PROJECT -->
<h2>Getting started with the project</h2>
<p>Knowing HTML and CSS is a plus, so you can do basic set ups to make your browser page more interesting to look at</p>
<p>Javascript...functions, functions, functions. THESE ARE YOUR FRIENDS (i still need to practice these; along with while loops, if/else statements...big picture is easy to think about(the concepts), but actually getting down and dirty with the code and having the ability to write decent code is by PRACTICE(sometimes i feel there aren't enough hours in the day, but i feel i'm making small steps every day, which is awesome).</p>
<p>What I did was to set up my HTML and CSS first, so the colors would help inspire me how to set my JavaScript code up</p>
<br>
<!-- WHERE USERS CAN GET HELP WITH YOUR PROJECT -->
<h2>Getting help with the project</h2>
<p>I definitely needed help with this, and here are some resources I used</p>
<p>MDN, W3Schools, Stackoverflow, and YouTube</p>
<p>Learning how to google for better results is something to learn on this coding journey</p>
